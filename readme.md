This a readme file that describe about what we did in this test.

To start this proggrem you fisrt need to run test_module.py!!

after that you can start evreything [col.py, simp.py , comp.py].


1. in simp.py , i made 2 functions that each one of them return my output.

2. in comp.py i made function that called sum_digits and sumed the methods with 5+5 in total result
#plus i made function that called palindrome,that if we reserved the numbers we get the same result and then we get True cause it cannot be reserved.

3. in col.py we took 2 diffrent array, names + numbers and defined them and after that we combine them to 1 array Example paz,1 eyal,2 etc.

5. When you try to run test_module.py you getting : 
 Exception occurred: You must call at least one function in the simp module before calling functions in the comp module.
